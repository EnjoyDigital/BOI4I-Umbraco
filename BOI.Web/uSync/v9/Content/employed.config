      <Value><![CDATA[<p>We will normally use 100% of contractually guaranteed income and the inclusion of non-guaranteed income (such as bonuses or regular commission) can be considered up to 50%. For non-guaranteed income to be considered we would need to evidence a track record of it being received and satisfy ourselves that it will be ongoing and sustainable.</p>
<p>Our underwriters have some discretion to use a different proportion of variable earnings but a historic record of these earnings will normally be required in order to exceed 50%, typically 3 years.</p>
<p>We'll take into consideration employment type and sector when considering ongoing sustainability.</p>
<p>We'll assess the latest P60 and the year to date income and will normally use the lowest figure.<br />If variable earnings are high we may ask for further documentation to evidence track record and future sustainability.</p>
<p>For bonus payments, we'll require evidence of the actual bonus paid.</p>
<p>Share awards, for example Restricted Stock Units will not be considered as bonuses and therefore cannot be used as variable income.</p>
<h5>New employment</h5>
<p>To consider income from a new role we would need:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="list-bullets">The new position to be in the same line of employment as current role</span></li>
<li><span class="list-bullets">Proof of new position and salary via the new job offer or accepted contract</span></li>
<li><span class="list-bullets">A condition of the mortgage offer may be receipt of the first payslip to confirm the applicant has started the new employment before we release the funds.</span></li>
</ul>
<h5><span class="list-bullets">A confirmed pay rise</span></h5>
<p>We’ll consider using income from a future pay rise subject to confirmation from the employer (such as a reference or pay rise notification).</p>
<p>We may request proof that the pay rise has taken effect where we can’t adequately confirm the salary increase.</p>]]></Value>
