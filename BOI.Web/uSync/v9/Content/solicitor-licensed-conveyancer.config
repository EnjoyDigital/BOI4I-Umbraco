      <Value><![CDATA[<p>The quickest way to get a mortgage offer issued is to choose a law firm on our approved panel. You can use our <a href="/{localLink:umb://document/2beccc4772794c249093abd9d9455b35}" title="Solicitor search"><strong>Solicitor Search</strong></a> tool to find which firms are already on our panel. Instructing a firm of solicitors/licensed conveyancers from our approved panel means they’ll act for both Bank of Ireland UK and your client. This will keep costs down and save time.</p>
<p>Please see our<span> </span><strong><a href="/{localLink:umb://media/a70af795ee3d4df1aacd90ee96e4dce9}" title="Your Guide To Legal Services">Legal Services Guide</a></strong><span> for more information. This includes how a firm can apply to be added to our panel if they’re not already listed.</span></p>
<p><strong>For purchases</strong>: your client can use a firm that isn’t on our panel if they wish. We’ll appoint our own firm to complete the legal work on our behalf. This is known as ‘Separate Representation’. The work required by both law firms must be submitted prior to completion taking place. This means the transaction:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="list-bullets">Can take longer to complete than using only one firm (from our approved panel)</span></li>
<li><span class="list-bullets">Could cost your client more as they'll have to pay two sets of legal fees.</span></li>
</ul>

Your client <strong>must use</strong> the law firm which our partner firm Legal Marketing Services Ltd (LMS) assign them for a fees assisted case. If your client wishes to use their own firm, they'll need to choose a product without standard legal fees paid, making them responsible for all legal costs and disbursements incurred.</span></span></p>]]></Value>
