      <Value><![CDATA[<p>We’ll require confirmation that your client has the right to live and work in the UK. Your client will need to have resided in the UK for long enough to ensure we have a meaningful credit score and employment history. This is normally a minimum of 3 years but we can consider less, subject to credit score.</p>
<p><strong>The following applicants can apply up to our maximum Loan to Value (LTV):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="list-bullets">Irish Nationals</span></li>
<li><span class="list-bullets">EU, EEA and Swiss Nationals with ‘settled status’</span></li>
<li><span class="list-bullets">Non-EU, EEA and Swiss Nationals with ‘indefinite leave to remain’</span></li>
<li><span class="list-bullets">Applicants who are born outside of the UK but who have received UK naturalisation.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>The following applicants can apply up to 75% LTV:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="list-bullets">EU, EEA and Swiss Nationals with ‘pre-settled status’</span></li>
<li><span class="list-bullets">Non-EU, EEA and Swiss Nationals with limited rights to work/remain in the UK. Only Innovator, and Global Talent visas (previously Tier 1), Skilled Worker visas (previously Tier 2) and Ancestral Visas are acceptable</span></li>
<li><span class="list-bullets">Second applicants on a dependent visa may be acceptable, subject to one applicant holding one of the above visas</span></li>
<li><span class="list-bullets">The underwriter will need to be satisfied that there is an adequate period of time remaining on the visa to warrant granting a long term loan. Where the applicant doesn’t have settled status, you should include details of your client’s long term plans.</span></li>
</ul>
