      <Value><![CDATA[<p>Purchases - maximum 85% Loan to Value (LTV) (90% for New Build Green Properties) and 80% LTV for flats.</p>
<p>We define New Build properties as those that have been built or converted within the last 12 months and are subject to a first sale, even if previously occupied.</p>
<p>Our offer of loan is valid for 9 months from the date of offer, unless stated otherwise in the offer document. If completion hasn't taken place before the offer expires, we can consider a 6 month extension. The application will be subject to a full reassessment against our current criteria including reverification of income and a re-valuation of the property.</p>
<p>The applicant will be charged for a re-valuation of the property if they keep the same product or choose a new product that doesn't have a free valuation. This must be paid before the offer is extended. We won't charge a fee if a new product is chosen that has a free valuation.</p>]]></Value>
