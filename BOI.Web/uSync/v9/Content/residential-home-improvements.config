</ul>
<p>Depending upon these answers supplemental questions may arise.</p>
<p>We'll not lend on properties that are part way through a project e.g. incomplete extensions, loft conversions, incomplete kitchens and bathrooms, etc.</p>
<p>We'll not lend on very dated properties (which show after being inspected) that most purchasers would modernise/refurbish soon after moving in.</p>]]></Value>
