If it’s not deemed safe, rather than delaying the case, desktop valuations will be carried out for applications up to and including 85% LTV. All applications must have a physical inspection where the requested LTV exceeds 85%. For cases where, for Covid-19 regulatory reasons a physical inspection isn’t possible, the valuation will be placed on hold until a time that one can be carried out, in accordance with the product’s requirements.<strong><br /><br /></strong>Our usual process remains unchanged and we’ll only issue a valuation report where a physical inspection has taken place. Please speak to your <a href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/8ad458ac45da4354b145b92f1b62a0a2}\" title=\"Find your BDM\">BDM </a>or Telephone BDM for advice.<br /><br />In order to maintain service levels and to support your business, we’ll continue to pay standard mortgage valuation and revaluation fee-scales. We’ll also, where possible, use all of our panel firms in order to maintain coverage across the UK.</p>"
