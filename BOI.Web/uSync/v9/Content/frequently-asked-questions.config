If this is a product transfer please go to the <a href=\"https://www.bankofireland4intermediaries.co.uk/frequently-asked-questions/#product-transfer\">product transfer FAQ</a>.</p>\n<p>If the new product has a free valuation, your client will not need to pay anything. However, if the new product does not have a free valuation, your client may be charged retrospectively for any valuations that have been carried out. You have three working days to pay the valuation fee, if applicable, to secure the product. Please make sure the features of the new product match the existing product. If not please check your client is happy to proceed. Once the request has been received we can't revert back to the original product. </p>\n<p>If the case has already been offered, we may undertake another credit check before we issue the amended offer. A change of product might also mean the application is reassessed by our underwriters, and may need additional information or documentation from you. Our decision to lend may be affected by a change to the product being requested or a change in your client's circumstances. </p>\n<p>For more information on any applicable charges, click <a href=\"https://www.bankofireland4intermediaries.co.uk/media/uz3pnx4r/tariffofmortgagechargesboi.pdf\">here</a>. </p>",

                    "markup": "<p>For a property within a block of flats or converted building where an External Wall System (cladding, stacked balconies, etc.), is of concern, building owners must be able to supply a suitable and comprehensive Fire Risk Assessment (FRA) Report based upon an assessment which has been carried out within the last five years, and after 01.01.2018.</p>\n<p>The report should contain an executive summary of the findings and a clearly defined overall risk rating for the building, including risk to life. It should include detailed commentary on the External Wall System. The FRA report will be reviewed by our Property Risk team, who will provide guidance on what solution will be required to ensure the property is an acceptable risk. This may include a new FRA Report to be published following the completion of remedial work and the Property Risk team may set additional requirements.</p>\n<p>We require the FRA report to have been signed by the suitably qualified specialist who inspected the building. The accepted qualifications for specialists are those identified within the RICS EWS1 Form list of relevant professional bodies. Only fully qualified members will be acceptable (i.e. Graduate or Student membership is not acceptable).</p>\n<p>We don't need to see the EWS1 form and there is no requirement for the Valuer to request one if they have cladding concerns. If the Valuer, in line with RICS Guidance, has concerns in respect of cladding, they must make these known to us, and recommend that the Fire Risk Assessment report be reviewed within their Valuation Report.</p>",
