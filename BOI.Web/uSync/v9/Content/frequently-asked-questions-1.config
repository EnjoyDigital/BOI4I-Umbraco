If this is a product transfer please go to the <a href=\"https://www.bankofireland4intermediaries.co.uk/frequently-asked-questions/#product-transfer\">product transfer FAQ</a>.</p>\n<p>If the new product has a free valuation, your client will not need to pay anything. However, if the new product does not have a free valuation, your client may be charged retrospectively for any valuations that have been carried out. You have three working days to pay the valuation fee, if applicable, to secure the product. Please make sure the features of the new product match the existing product. If not please check your client is happy to proceed. Once the request has been received we can't revert back to the original product. </p>\n<p>If the case has already been offered, we may undertake another credit check before we issue the amended offer. A change of product might also mean the application is reassessed by our underwriters, and may need additional information or documentation from you. Our decision to lend may be affected by a change to the product being requested or a change in your client's circumstances. </p>\n<p>For more information on any applicable charges, click <a href=\"https://www.bankofireland4intermediaries.co.uk/media/uz3pnx4r/tariffofmortgagechargesboi.pdf\">here</a>. </p>",
